# JOURNEY OPTIMISATION README

journey_optimisation.zip uses A* drone routing algorithm with a weighted graph to produce optimal journeys for 94 healthcare facilities based in Kaduna State.

There are 2 scripts: 
1)optimal_P_journey_planner.py 
2)optimal_P_set_txt_export.py

There are 4 maps: 
1)map_kaduna.png
2)O_map.png
3)T_map.png
4)W_map.png

List of healthcare facilities: 
1)healthcare_facilities.csv


## Installation

Download journey_optimisation.zip from `https://github.com/al4517/drone-delivery`

## Usage

1)optimal_P_journey_planner.py = Determines the optimal drone paths and P values for all healthcare facilities

2)optimal_P_set_txt_export.py = Calculates the final costs from the optimised values and outputs a txt file of the results
